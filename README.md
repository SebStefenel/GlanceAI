## 🔑 Setup: SetUp Your Own API Key

To use this extension, **you must generate your own API key from [Together.ai](https://www.together.ai)**. The extension relies on the Together API to generate AI summaries, and each user must authenticate with their own key.

### ✅ How to Get Started:

1. **Sign up at** [https://www.together.ai](https://www.together.ai)
2. Go to the **API Keys** section in your account dashboard
3. **Generate a new key**
4. Open the extension’s **Background page** 
5. **Paste your API key** and click **Save**

The extension will now use your key to summarize links via the `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3` model.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Do not share your API key publicly — it is tied to your usage quota and billing.
